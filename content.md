## Web and App Design
[IRL.RPG app mockup]\
Click to try the mobile prototype!
- **Course:** IDM 213
- **Software:** Figma, Adobe After Effects
- **Project Description:**\
&ensp; &ensp; IRL.RPG is a habit-building and productivity app that gamifies users’ everyday tasks through a range of retro RPG elements.  Users create an avatar within the app, then add tasks they want to complete; once a task is completed in real life, checking it off in the app earns in-game currency, experience, and items for a true RPG experience.  IRL.PRG uses a blend of productivity features, game-like features, and a pixel art style to create a novel task-managing experience.

&ensp; &ensp; This lightbox is themed after the Persona 5 game, featuring each of the main Phantom Thieves, the PT logo, and the Metaverse Navigator icon on the cutout sides.  A bundle of red LEDs are wired to a coin battery on the inside of the box, which rests atop another box that houses the wiring for the music player, which plays a short version of vanilla P5’s battle theme, Last Surprise (using this as a reference).  This is also shown on the LCD, for which a picture is included above.  The box and all its cutouts are laser cut and engraved.\
&ensp; &ensp; As a side note, the LCD was meant to display scrolling messages, including the “Now Playing” text.  Unfortunately, the music player and the scrolling LCD could not be run in the same loop—these needed their own loops (and thus, their own cores/Arduinos) to work properly.  I have included both the music and the functional scrolling code.\

[Project NICE]\
&ensp; &ensp; In engineering, creative design is intrinsically involved in both practice and education, but its development and manifestation within engineering populations are understudied.  To get a better understanding of how creativity influences senior engineering students who may have an underdeveloped ability to approach design problems creatively as novices in the field by the end of their college career, the project aims to examine both physiological data as well as students' personal creative beliefs.\
&ensp; &ensp; Some questions, theories, and goals going into the project were as follows:\
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; - What impact do evaluation expectations have on student creativity?  It is thought that the anticipation of being evaluated by an instructor may be more detrimental to creativity than evaluation by one’s peers, because students may be more comfortable with other students.\
&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; - What facilitates or hinders student creativity in engineering design?  Understanding the impact of feedback expectations and self-beliefs on creative performance can inform best practices for pre-professional training in STEM.\
&ensp; &ensp; In this project, a total of 55 senior mechanical and electrical engineering students were instructed to complete an open-ended design task in the lab to design a knowledge retrieval system for a small library to improve engagement and accessibility to library materials for children and young adults.  They were randomly assigned to expect instructor feedback, peer feedback, or self-evaluation on their solution and were explicitly instructed to be creative.  The students' designs were recorded in real time, and subjects' heart rate and skin conductance data were also collected to examine stress.  After the design task was complete, students quantitatively rated their own beliefs about creativity and were interviewed about creativity in their work in relation to instructors, peers, and the self.  These interviews were recorded and coded for evidence of creative growth, partial creative growth, or creative fixed mindsets and emotional blocks to creativity.\
&ensp; &ensp; After the testing period, students' designs were coded by two PhD engineering instructors for novelty, appropriateness, and fluency.  Physiological data was cleaned and examined, and qualitative interviews were transcribed and coded for evidence of creative mindsets, as well as creativity enabling and hindering conditions.\
&ensp; &ensp; Surprisingly, it was found that engineering students generally perform better on a creative design task when expecting feedback from an instructor.  Additionally, greater heart rate variability during the design brief was associated with greater design novelty, suggesting greater adaptability to stress.\
&ensp; &ensp; Students expressed varied self-beliefs about creativity and the importance of creativity in engineering, particularly when being evaluated.  Creative self-beliefs were not associated with design quality, but may be associated with positive affect and baseline heart rate variability.  Engineering students reported difficulties being creative under conditions of emotional stress, negative judgment, logistical and administrative constraints, pressure, insufficient reward, and so on.\
&ensp; &ensp; Though the research does not conclusively point to perceived creative mindsets influencing design task creativity, trending creative blocks and other insights gained through data such as student interviews, for example, may potentially be used to better inform best practices in the classroom and lab.  Project NICE is still underway, and will be taking steps to further examine the data collected during the design task.\

[Book Reviews]\
[Don’t Make Me Think]\
&ensp; &ensp; Steve Krug’s “Don’t Make Me Think” was both easily enjoyable and digestible, serving as a one-stop crash course-like guide to web usability and user experience.  The author’s desire for simplicity—evident by the book’s title and primary principle, “don’t make me think”—is prevalent throughout, which made this a surprisingly blunt and practical read.  Each chapter is notably supplied with images to help keep the reader engaged, the concepts reinforced, and the critical thinking low.  In his introduction, Krug asserts that the general reader, as a usability non-professional, doesn’t need to know everything, and that there isn’t even a cemented “right” way to do design; rather, he believes that there are a set of guiding principles useful to anyone interested in learning usability basics.\
&ensp; &ensp; Which leads us, once again, into Krug’s “first law” of usability—none other than “don’t make me think.”  This concept not only serves as the foundation for the rest of the principles in the book, but even meshes with Krug’s manner of writing—fun and yet blunt enough for the average reader to get the point immediately.  What could probably be called the rule of mindlessness states that a web page should be self-evident, with every possible interaction made obvious.  And if that isn’t possible, then the page should at the very least be self-explanatory.  Krug stresses that a terrible thing you could do as a designer is to make a user stop and think—even if the hesitation is only a few milliseconds.  Small stumbles add up to muddling, and a large toll on a user’s mental capacity will make them frustrated, so it should be avoided at any cost.  People don’t use websites the way they think they do—as much as we’d all like to think we’re prim and orderly about browsing the web, people work chaotically and make split-second decisions.  In Krug’s words, we tend to consume web pages like they’re “billboard[s] going by at 60 miles an hour” rather than “great literature”—we’re always on a time crunch and can’t afford to be slowed down with our thoughts.\
&ensp; &ensp; Adding on to the reality of the average person’s web browsing tendencies, Krug effectively defines three “facts of life” that explain the difference between our idealized behaviors and our actual ones.  First: we scan pages, not read them.  Much like we were likely expected to do with the book itself, most people simply cannot be bothered to read, especially when things are text-heavy and uninteresting to them.  Second: contrary to popular opinion, we don’t make optimal decisions—we just make the decision we think is right at the time.  While this can be boiled down to instinct, Krug calls it “satisficing,” which essentially is a term for doing what we think is “good enough.”  Because we’re always in such a hurry to do things, we don’t want to spend time reading, and certainly don’t want to spend time thinking things through.  So we satisfice to just to get some “good enough” results.  Third: we muddle, rather than figure things out.  No one ever reads manuals, particularly for the first life fact—most people simply opt to make things work through brute force.  It might not be efficient or even correct, but because we don’t care enough, we learn just enough to be done and move on.\
&ensp; &ensp; Krug’s straight-to-the-point wording comes in once again when he discusses the principle of omitting words.  People don’t want to read, because it forces them to think.  By “[getting] rid of half the words on each page, then [getting] rid of half of what’s left,” a designer can cut down on the clutter and prose and get to the heart of the matter.  “Happy talk” and “instructions” must die, Krug writes, and as humorous as it sounds, it’s meant literally—reducing the amount of meaningless text reduces the noise on a web page.  It’s like an exercise for English I had last term: cut out as many words as possible without losing meaning.  It really does make people think less.\
&ensp; &ensp; All of the principles in Steve Krug’s titular book ultimately ties back to the same goal—“don’t make me think.”  In the end, as Krug puts it, usability is largely about common sense.  Simplify as much as possible to make it easy for the user, and the user will enjoy the experience more.  In my opinion, “Don’t Make Me Think” is a great reference for those involved in web usability and are interested in UX basics.

[Analog In, Digital Out]\
**Use your own words to describe your favorite part of the book (cite section number) and define why this section resonates with you?**\
&ensp; &ensp; In some ways, my favorite part of the book is the introduction.  (And I apologize if this technically doesn’t count as a section.)  Almost immediately, the section opens with a hilarious anecdote, highlighting an exchange Dawes had at a conference that inspired him to write the book; the subtext amusing for those of us (like him, probably) who have yet to shake that trashy, juvenile sense of humor.  Dawes then proceeds to introduce himself to us, the readers, in an almost confidently self-deprecating manner—giving us more anecdotes about his origins in programming and design.  With that, he outlines what he hopes the reader might get out of his book—an ability to simply jump in rather than go through all the fancy discipline hoops—and to be provoked in some way.  Reading just this introduction alone, I was totally gripped by Dawes’ writing.  I thought to myself, wow, this is so riveting!  Surely the rest of the book will be just as exciting of a read!  (And while I did find the rest of the book nice, the other sections didn’t jump out at me quite like the introduction.)  I loved Dawes’ almost overly-casual tone that fit perfectly with his “no credentials” declaration, and the anecdotes that made up most of the section set the stage for what the rest of the book would be like.  Best of all, I think, was that he sounded relatable. Hand in hand with his easygoing tone (free of “malarkey,” as he says) is how he still sounds like, well, a kid.  In a way.  In a good way.  It just goes to show how you don’t have to sound like you have a PhD and 20 years of sleep debt to know what you’re talking about.  And besides, I think the introduction being my favorite part is a part of the user experience itself, right?  In my opinion, it has some distinct call-backs to “Brown Paper and String” Moments (Section 3).  It just really drew me in.

**Discuss how this book relates to your chosen degree (UXID)?**\
&ensp; &ensp; This book is clearly about user interaction, user experience, approaches to design, and all things “how to make things in new ways.”  It’s a presentation of tips and tricks on how to change your perspective and how to stretch your creativity with anecdotes on how it happened to Dawes.  More than one section calls on the reader to look at their surroundings more closely, or to look at everyday things (like the pencil or the iPAL) for their stellar, simple, intuitive design.  It certainly brings in a good deal of product design, discusses the craft of iteration, and even goes as far to demonstrate “interfaces” in everything. Even Play-Doh.  It’s not an academic read by any means, and even Dawes himself asserts that there would be no research or user testing or any of the formal things I’d expect to learn in class, even just for vocabulary purposes, covered in his book.  It’s a field notes journal for UXID and design in general, bringing to light the things you might not notice just by following the formal process.

**Describe how you plan to use the lessons in this book during your studies here at Drexel?**\
&ensp; &ensp; Dawes’ book is inspiring in a way that “I’m probably not smart enough to really understand or imitate anything he’s doing,” but the takeaways from his anecdotes always give me something to think about.  Section by section, it’s always the more simple things that he stresses, like how a fun experience could be better than an efficient one, or how more constraints could lead to greater creativity and new ways of thinking.  Things don’t always have to be useful if people can appreciate them (which is, ironically, directly opposing the line of thought taught to us in PROD 215).  Simplicity is beautiful (which actually falls in line with PROD 215 thinking).  You can make something out of anything, provided you have the tools. Really, the lessons in this book don’t necessarily teach things that are new, in my opinion.  Rather, they seem to assert the things that we keep in our subconscious and tell us to draw them out more.  Think intuitively.  Consider the little things.  Reuse.  It feels as if it wants me to be more aware of everything, whether it be myself or my environment or other people.  I’ll try.

&ensp; &ensp; Using the basic Unity platformer tutorial as a guide, the class was split into teams and instructed to modify the game in some way.  Our team opted to recreate the game in a pixel artstyle.  My personal task was to translate the player character into pixel art, which included all the sprite sheets for animation.  In the end, I took a more fantasy-leaning approach to their design, tying this in with another addition our team opted for—collectible gem tokens the player could gather along the path.
